## Implementation Priorities 

For each module in the transformation, focus on:

1. **MVP First**: Implement core functionality before adding enhancements
2. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementing features
3. **Incremental Value**: Prioritize features that deliver immediate business value
4. **Continuous Validation**: Regularly verify optimization results against benchmarks
5. **Early Integration**: Connect components as early as possible to identify integration issues
6. **Documentation**: Document as you go, not as an afterthought

## Development Timeline Estimates

| Stage | Estimated Time | Team Size |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Foundation Setup | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 developers |
| Core Algorithm Adaptation | 2-3 weeks | 1-2 developers |
| Data Integration Framework | 2-3 weeks | 1-2 developers |
| Forecasting System | 3-4 weeks | 1-2 developers |
| Web Dashboard | 2-3 weeks | 1-2 developers |
